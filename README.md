# hello-world

Hello,everyone!
Ray Wang here, this is my first time using github.
All I want to say is amazing.
Me, a contryside boy, want to do something different at the begining of my career.
I work for a real estate developer, but I don't like it.I prefer to do a machine learning job.
So let's get started.
